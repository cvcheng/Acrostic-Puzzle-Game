## How is the game played?

The game is related to a crossword puzzle but it is the letters of the answer to a clue that are used in another puzzle.
A series of clues are given for individual words. Each letter is assigned a number which will be used to assemble the final quotation.

## Here is an example:

The two clues are: 

1. Complete, not divided: __ __ __ __ __

                            6  1  5  3  2

2. a humorous, whimsical, or odd quality:  __ __ __ __ __
					   
                                          10  8  7  4  9

The solution is always a quotation with numbered spaces:  __ __ __ __ __   __ __ __ __ __
							  
                                                         1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

If the answer to clue 1 is "whole", then the solution fills in as: h e l __ o  __ __ __ l __

                                                           1 2 3 4 5 6  7  8 9 10


If the answer to clue 2 is "droll", then the quotation turns out to be: h  e  l  l  o w  o  r  l  d
